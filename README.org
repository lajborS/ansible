* Ansible

Hi everyone,

this is simple ansible-playbook for install and configuration basic settings webserver with HAproxy, PHP, NGINX and MariaDB.

Testing on Debian 8 Jessie.

** Using:

First you must to state ours server in */etc/ansible/hosts* on your local computer 
for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
[webservers]
sub.example.com
10.13.56.10
#+END_SRC

It is possible to use FQDN or IP adress remote server.

Since Ansible requires running under the root user, you need to upload the private ssh key to the root server into the authorized_keys file:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh sub.example.com "mkdir -p /root/.ssh && cat >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys" 
#+END_SRC

Now clone repo with ansible, switch to directory *ansible* and let's play:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ansible-playbook main.yml
#+END_SRC
